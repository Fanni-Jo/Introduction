## Our website features :

- When you press on one of the categories , you can purview all the workers in that field.

- It is easy to find the type of worker you need , such as : painter,bakerâ€¦

## The website services:

We provide a profile for each worker that contains the following : 
- information about the worker : name , email , the type of work they introduce for the client . 
- previous works for them with the picture and description for each one . 
- contact us section : which show the whatsapp for the workers , so the client can contact with them . 
- comments section : the client can write the feedback about this worker and the effeciency of the work .
